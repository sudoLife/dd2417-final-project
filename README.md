# dd2417-final-project

This repository contains code for our final project (abstract text summarization) in DD2417 Natural Language Engineering.

## How to train

To train, you need to add your HuggingFace token to `run_summarization.sh` and run the script.

The main training parameters are provided and may be tweaked as desired.

## How to run inference

An example is provided in the `inference.ipynb` notebook. You may also visit [sudoLife/tst-summarization](https://huggingface.co/sudoLife/tst-summarization) to try out the T5-Small model or [ChaniM/tst-summarization](https://huggingface.co/ChaniM/tst-summarization) to try Pegasus.
